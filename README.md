============
Various codes written in Java.

Right now this contains a BankAccount project I am working on for my Object Oriented Porgramming class.
[*] BankAccount:
	It has a GUI(exteremly basic stuff). 
	It reads bankaccounts from a file " bankaccountfile.txt".
	It can save them in serilized formats.
	There are threee possible types of bankaccounts, Fixed depoiste, checking, and savings. Right now there's no GUI for creating accounts, only for using them in an ATM.
	

	As of now, no futher development will be done, the project is nearly completed.
